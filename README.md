# React Thread App!
You're able to get a user and get the threads associated with that user, as well as replies.
Also, you can interact with each thread by posting likes and posting new threads, either by replaying to existing ones or just new ones in general.
In addition, there is a link to the Instagram page based on the user's Instagram page as well as an option to share it by copying to clipboards.

I used a dv.json file, and didn't connect it to an actual database.
